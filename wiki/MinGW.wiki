A complete build environment and sources used to compile the libraries included in MPlayer are available at the following URL: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/smplayer/files/MinGW/mplayer]

Extract and edit `MinGW\msys\etc\fstab` according to where you extracted it. Launch the MSYS shell by executing `MinGW\msys\msys.bat`.
